1.1 Purpose

In today’s rapidly evolving job market, it can be difficult for students to transition from university to the working world. Students struggle to find opportunities that fit their skills and career goals, and companies spend a huge amount of time and effort trying to identify the right candidates. It’s critical to tackle this problem as a mismatch can influence a student’s early career development and a company’s ability to gather relevant talents.
Students&Companies (S&C) tries to solve this problem. The platform allows students to search for internships, receive personalised recommendations, and refine their profiles to better align with industry expectations. Companies can advertise internships, receive tailored candidate suggestions, and benefit from a simplified hiring process through structured tools and mechanisms. Universities can monitor internships, ensure educational standards are met, and handle complaints or issues that may arise during internships.

1.1.1 Goals
[G1] Students search for internships that align with their skills and career goals
[G2] Companies advertise their internships, projects, and benefits
[G3] Companies and students are connected and begin the selection process (e.g., interviews, questionnaires)
[G4] Students and companies receive feedback after each selection process
[G5] Students and companies receive suggestions for improvement
[G6] Universities monitor internship progress, complaints and issues

1.2 Scope
In this section, we define the domain of the Students&Companies(S&C) platform, which serves two primary user groups : students and companies. The platform is designed to simplify the process of matching students with internship opportunities based on their skills and aspirations, while allowing companies to find the most suitable candidates for their internship offers.
For students, the process begins with creating an account on the platform, where they upload their CVs and other relevant documents. Companies, on the other hand, create detailed internship offers that describe the tasks, required skills and benefits. The platform uses matching algorithms to help both parties find the best fit. Once students apply, companies can review CVs, send assessments, schedule interviews, and select candidates.
The platform also sends personalized suggestions:
●	To students : the platform provides suggestions for improving their CVs and profiles to better match industry expectations
●	To companies : the platform suggests ways to make internship offers more appealing
After each selection process, the platform collects feedback from both students and companies. This feedback is analyzed and shared with relevant parties to refine recommendations and further improve the matching process.
1.2.1 World Phenomena
These are the real-world events or actions that influence how the platform works :
[WP1] Companies define internship needs
[WP2] Students prepare and update their CVs
[WP3] Students decide which internships to apply for
[WP4] Companies decide which candidates to interview or assess
[WP5]  Students and companies provide feedback on the selection process and interactions
1.2.2 Shared Phenomena
These phenomena are controlled by both the world (students, companies, universities) and the machine (platform algorithms and systems) :
World-Controlled Phenomena

●	[SP4] Students apply for internships
●	[SP5] Students receive recommendations and decide to accept or decline
●	[SP6] Companies receive and evaluate student applications
●	[SP7] Companies receive recommendations and decide to accept or decline
●	[SP8] Companies initiate interviews or assessments for selected candidates
●	[SP9] Universities monitor internship and address complaints or issues
●	[SP10] Students update their profiles
Machine-Controlled Phenomena
●	[SP11] The system matches students with internships
●	[SP12] The system notifies students about relevant internships
●	[SP13] The system alerts companies about suitable candidates
