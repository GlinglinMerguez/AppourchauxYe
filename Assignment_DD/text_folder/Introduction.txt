Personalized suggestions and recommendations generated by intelligent algorithms help students enhance their profiles and companies improve their internship pffers.
The  ultimate purpose of the platform is to create a practical, engaging and efficient way for students to gain meanignful experiences, for companies to find the right talent and for universities to maintain high education standards.
