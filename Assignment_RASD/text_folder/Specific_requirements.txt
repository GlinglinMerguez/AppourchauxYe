3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
Our platform is a web app, as a consequence, it does not require any specific hardware
 interface except for computer and any other device with web browser.

3.1.3 Software Interfaces
 The system will integrate with:
 • Email services: For sending notifications, such as interview schedules and application updates
 • Third-party APIs (University Internal Online Sercive): For university background checks
 • External database systems : 
    • Relational database (e.g. cloud-hosted MySQL) to store user information, intership offers and feedback
    • NoSQL database (e.g. MongoDB Atlas) for storing unstructured data, such as CSV files or applications logs


3.1.4 Communication Interfaces
The system will use the following communication protocols:
1. HTTPS
    • For secure communication between the platform and its users
    • HTTPS ensures data security by encrypting sensitive information, such as login credentials and feedback submissions
    • This guarantees data privacy and integrity during communication
2. RESTful APIs
    • For interaction between frontend (user interface) and backend services (server logic)
    • Enables strctured data exchange and facilitates integration with third-party services like email systems or university APIs
    • This ensures scalability and flexibility for future enhancements
3. WebSocket
    • For real-time communication between the platform and its users, such as real-time updates on application statuses, interviews schedules, feedback and notifications
