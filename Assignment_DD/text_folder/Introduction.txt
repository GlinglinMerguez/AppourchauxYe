1.1 Purpose
In today's competitive job market, students often face challenges transitioning from university to workplace, struggling to find opportunites that match their skills and career aspirations. At the same time, companies invest significant time and resources in identifying the right candidates.
The Students & Companies (S&C) platform addresses these challenges by connecting students, companies and universities in an unified ecosystem. Students can discover internships tailored to their skills and career goals, while companies gain access to a pool of qualified candidates. Universities, on the other hand, can monitor internship progress to ensure educational standards are respected.
The platform goes beyond simply matching students and companies. It supports the recruitment process with tools for interviews, tests and feedback. Personalized suggestions and recommendations generated by intelligent algorithms help students enhance their profiles and companies improve their internship pffers.
The  ultimate purpose of the platform is to create a practical, engaging and efficient way for students to gain meanignful experiences, for companies to find the right talent and for universities to maintain high education standards.

1.2 Scope
As mentioned in the RASD, there are three primary users that interact with the system : Students, Companies and Universities.
• Students can create accounts, upload their CVs and search for internship opportunities that align with their skills and career goals. They can apply to internships directly through the platform and participate in recruitment processes, including tests and interviews. Moreover, students receive personalized suggestions to improve their profiles and recommendations for internships based ont heir qualifications and preferences. They can also provide feedhback on the recuitment process or submit complaints when necessary.
• Companies can post detailed internship offers, specifying the required qualifications, skills and benefits.They can manage applications, evaluate candidates through tests or interviews, and provide feedback on student performance. Companies also receive recommendations for suitable candidates and actionable suggestions to enhance their internship offers. Moreover, they can submit complaints or report issues regarding the recruitment process.
• Universities have tools to monitor the internship process, ensuring alignment with educational standards and addressing complaints raised by students or companies. They are responsible for resolving conflicts and maintaining oversight of the internships to ensure compliance with academic and professional guidelines. 

The platform acts as a mediator between these users, facilitating efficient communication, seamless recruitment processes and personalized experiences. The system integrates intelligent algorithms to match students with suitable internships and companies with qualified candidates. It also enables real-time notifications, feedback analysis and structured tools for managing every step of the internship journey - from application to final selection.
